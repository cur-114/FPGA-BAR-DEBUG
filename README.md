# XHCI-DEBUG-TOOL
This application implements the behavior of BAR using pcileech callback.
The purpose of this project is to first understand how xhci works using callbacks, as it is very difficult to implement in verilog from scratch.
We also use imgui to visualize the status of registers, etc.
It is very difficult to confirm a lot of information using text alone.
